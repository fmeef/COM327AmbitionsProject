===========================================================

I grew up in a rather peaceful and quiet setting. I lived in a relatively
diverse neighborhood with the right amount of friends and enough of the
ordinary life staples that most kids needed to grow up. Luckily for me, my
parents hated travel, so I lived in the same house for all of my childhood,
with only a few moments of sadness as a few kids moved away (but sometimes
moved back later). 

 Most people would have considered me socially awkward at that time. I even
considered myself that way. It did not really bother me, as I saw it as a
byproduct of being nerdy or hyper-analytical. I was sort of obsessive about
thins at that time as well, especially at a very young age of 3 to 4 years
old. I would repeatedly flip light switches and keep trying to point out fans
to people. At a later age, I centered around computers, science, and various
engineering things.
